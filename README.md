# üéì Bachelor Thesis: GPU-Optimized Semantic Search on Video Transcripts

## üìå Overview
This repository documents my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science thesis project** at **FORTH (Foundation for Research and Technology ‚Äì Hellas)**.  
The project implemented an **end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline**, enabling **semantic search over video transcripts** with results enriched by **timestamps and video identifiers**. 

‚ú® Key features include:  
- **RAG Architecture**: Combined video transcript retrieval with embedding-based semantic search.  
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Built a **Django REST Framework** API for embedding generation, vector storage, and similarity search.  
- **Semantic Video Transcript Search**: Extracted audio from videos, transcribed with **OpenAI Whisper**, and embedded with **BERT**.  
- **GPU Optimization**: Leveraged **PyTorch + FAISS GPU** for high-performance similarity search and efficient memory use.
- **Vector Database Benchmarking**: Conducted a comparative study of **FAISS, Pinecone, and PostgreSQL**  
- **Embedding Optimization**  
- **Deployment**: Containerized the system with **Docker** for reproducibility and portability.  
- **Environment**: Developed in **Python on Linux Ubuntu**, running exclusively on **FORTH‚Äôs GPU infrastructure via VPN**.


‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The source code is not publicly available due to infrastructure and legislation restrictions. This repository serves as a **portfolio showcase**. Access for review under supervision is possible by request.

## üìä Vector Database Benchmarks & Embedding optimization 

**Embedding Optimization**:  
  - Applied **normalization (L2, quantization, etc.)** for space and time efficiency.  
  - Matched **embedding normalization strategies** with appropriate similarity search methods (inner product, cosine similarity, Euclidean distance). 

**Vector Databse Benchmarks**
I tested and compared FAISS, Pinecone, and PostgreSQL on:  
- **Accuracy and integrity** of top-k retrieved results  
- **Query speed / latency** and API response time (time complexity)  
- **Storage efficiency** under different embedding optimization strategies (space complexity)

**Each benchmark combined**:  
- Embedding normalization choice.  
- Appropriate similarity search metric.
